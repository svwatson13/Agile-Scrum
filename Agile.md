### AGILE
# Agile is a mindset not a specific technique
- Lots of techniques which are based on AGILE e.g. scrum
# Agile Manifesto/ Values and Principles:
1) Individuals & Interactions
2) Working Software
3) Customer Collaboration
4) Responding to Change

### Scrum
# Application/Implication of AGILE
- Team based framework to develop software & products
- Consisting of:

-- Backlog (All tasks)
--- Product Backlog  - prioritised based on business value and estimated effort e.g. Planning Poker or T-shirt sizes (assigning value to each task and then dishing out tasks)
--- Backlog Refinement - managing backlog - moving tasks on scrum board and also splitting stories that are high priority


-- Sprint Backlog (Tasks planned to be completed in next sprint)
--- Moving product backlog into sprint section on scrum board

-- Sprint/Doing (Sprint)

-- Sprint Review (2-4 hours) key points:
1) Everyone needs to confirm that task is done, especially product owner
2) The developers need to discuss the problems they encountered during the sprint and how they were solved.
3) The Scrum team answers sprint-related questions from the rest of the team.
4) The team should discuss which tasks come next, something that gives a great basis for the next sprint planning meeting.

-- Done - move tasks to final done section

-- Sprint Retrospective (30mins - 3hours) key questions:
1) What went well during the sprint?
2) Is there anything that can be improved?
3) How can we make those improvements?
Retrospective Prime Directive: Team done best possible job
